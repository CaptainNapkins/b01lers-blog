## How to Post

- Create a new markdown file within the ```__posts``` directory
- Add the requisite header information (see other posts for examples)
- Write your post in markdown! 
- To add your post to the site:
    - Create a new .md file within the repository and then simply commit the changes. 
    - You can do it all within the repository on Github.com!

## Purpose

- This will be a place where b01lers members can showcase their CTF solves by making a blog post
- All solves will be placed under the ```Blog``` section of the website
- A post for the event as a whole will be created under the ```CTF``` section, allowing for a general overview of the event
    - Solves from that CTF will also be archived under that post to make searching for solves for a particular event easier. 

## Additional Information

 - If you'd like to use the default ```B01lers Team``` author when creating your post you may do so
    - Otherwise, you can create an ```author``` entry within the ```__config.yml``` file following the current template.
